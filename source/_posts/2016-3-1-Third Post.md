At first glance objects and classes seem to be very similar things in ruby, but in reality have a surprising relationship; classes are templates that can construct infinite similar objects. Stated in the most basic ways, classes are the things that can construct a large number of objects that are identical in structure. To help understand the difference between the two, one can look at objects and classes in the context of Facebook, a popular social media website. 

A class can be compared to a cookie cutter; a class is a thing that can produce infinite products that all have the same dimensions, like a cookie cutter. With a class, one creates many objects, or a cookie, that can be personalised with many different features, like frosting or sprinkles. The designers of Facebook needed to make a user class when they first started their website. This class would be the template that allowed every user to design a personalized profile, that would be used for the website. Within the user class, the designer’s of facebook defined methods that allowed users to add pictures, link their emails, post comments, and like things. Basically, the Facebook user class is a template that allows users to customize profiles, that are at their core identical. 

An object is like a noun in the coding world, it has traits that define it just like a word in the english language. Using Facebook as an example, each user is an object. They all have specific traits, a password, ability to post and like, and an email joined with their account. To make these profiles, one uses the user class. Every Facebook account has similar features that are set by the class. Essentially, all classes are identically structures, but are superficially different. Like a cookie made by  cookie cutter, objects produced by a class have the same “bones” but are superficially different.
