While looking in the system preferences app of an Iphone one sees a small section under the safari button labelled cookies and data. In smaller font within this cookies and data section one may be able to see a few options about a more obscure thing called  sessions as well. So what are cookies and sessions? To understand what these two things are you must first understand what HTTP is. HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol is one of the most important things because it is essential for the internet to work. HTTP basically allows clients, people with computers, to communicate with servers, websites that contain the information that people want. The thing that makes HTTP interesting is that it is stateless, which means that the protocol has no memory of what it does and does not interact with its past actions. This means that if you are trying to shop on line and add something to your cart and navigate to a new page your browser will not remember what you added to your cart. To solve this issue computer scientists came up with cookies and sessions. 

In a way, one can think of cookies as extensions of HTTP that identify the client to a web page. The first idea that was somewhat like current cookies was to have the website send the client a small symbul so that the client could be recognized again when they sent another request to the website. Currently,  a “cookie is a small text file that is stored by a browser on the user’s machine. Cookies are plain text; they contain no executable code,”. Basically, cookies are little bits of text that allow clients to be recognized by web servers. Once they are recognized, they can use information from past actions on the website.

A session is basically a prolonged dialogue between a client and a server. Using cookies, a session allows a client to be recognized by a server for a finite amount of time. An example of a session is being continually logged into a website even after closing out of it. Facebook uses sessions to keep users logged in to the sight.The reason that some people think that cookies and sessions are somewhat risky is because not all web browsers encrypt their information. Most people use HTTPS which encrypts information, making sessions and cookies totally safe. If one’s web browser did not encrypt their information a user could be more easily hacked and have someone see their interactions with a certain website.
