It is commonly believed that there are two types of mindsets; fixed and growth. Both were identified by Carol Dweck, a renowned psychologist based out of Stanford. A person with a fixed mindset, “assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can’t change in any meaningful way,” and avoids failure at any cost. A person with a growth mindset believed that intelligence can be developed and sees failure as a way to learn instead of a mark of a lack of intelligence. These mindsets are clearly different and cause people to approach learning in two very distinct ways. When learning a new craft, like programming, these two mindsets become very important.

For the purpose of programming,  one should try to stay in a growth mindset. A growth mindset allows a person to learn and work assuming that they can develop their skills, instead of assuming that they are naturally or not naturally talented at something. This mindset works well with adversity, because failure is seen as a learning experience instead of a show of lack of ability. Programming is a thing that is obviously very difficult, where most lessons are learned through failure. Obviously, learning programming with a fixed mindset is hard because these natural failures are seen as signs of ineptness, instead of learning experiences. Additionally, programming can often be very confusing; people with fixed mindsets do not work well with confusion. Clearly, programming should be performed by a person with a growth mindset. Programming is naturally a confusing and error riddled affar, which are two things that people with growth mindsets can easily overcome.

Fixed and growth mindsets are two very different things that are both suited for different tasks. A growth mindset is better than a fixed mindset when it comes to programming because it allows people to cope with the naturally difficult nature of programming. In fact a growth mindset is crucial to learning to program. A person have an extremely difficult time learning to program if they attributed all of their mistakes to a lack of ability. Having a fixed mindset would give a person an excuse for not filling immersing themselves in the trying pursuit of programming.
