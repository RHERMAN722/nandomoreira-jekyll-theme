After this websites previous posts about the differences between objects and classes, it is only natural that a post pertaining to classes should come next. A very important concept that goes along with classes is class inheritance. Basically, class inheritance is just a relationship with two classes or multiple classes. The main functionality of class inheritance is, “that classes lower down the hierarchy get the features of those higher up, but can also add specific features of their own.” This inheritance of traits is extremely useful when a programmer utilizes classes that are related but not exactly similar. The benefit of using class inheritance is that it makes the code more concise. Instead of recording traits for each class they are passed down between classes. 

	The best way to explain the concept of class inheritance is to walk through one. In this instance I arbitrarily choose animal to be our master class. All animals have certain traits like being alive and needing some sort of nutrition to continue to be alive. These two traits, there can be more than two, are passed down to classes below them. Below our animal class, or our master class, there is reptile class and mammal class. Both of these classes inherited the two traits form the master class, and now get their own traits. We will give mammal class warm blooded and has hair for its two classes. From class mammal we can do another two sub classes. Our two subclasses are class dog and class dolphin. These two classes inherit all of the traits that class mammal had and are assigned their own. As you can see using class inheritance is enormously useful because it greatly reduces the amount of code that one has to write. The passing down of traits is also useful because it makes the code easier to use. Even better, is that using class inheritance in ruby is incredibly simple and can be easily figured out.
