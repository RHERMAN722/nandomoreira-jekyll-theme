Websites. Millions of people visit and use them everyday, but how many people really know what they are? Well in the most basic terms a website is just a collection of files than can be accessed by a user at home. For the rest of the blog post, keep in mind that the user, or person at home, is referred to as the client and the actual website is referred to as the server. Using HTML, which is a system used to arrange text and photos, the files and documents are arranged into what the user sees. 
To better understand what a website it, lets walk through how one accesses a website. A client, or a user, first starts with a portable computer. He sits down and types in the domain name of the website that he wishes to access. His computer translates this domain name into the I.P address of the website's  servers using as  system called DNS. Domain Name System is basically like a phonebook that keeps track of domain names and their corresponding I.P addresses. Using DNS,  our user attempts to access Facebook. When our user types in Facebook he sends something called  get request the the nearest router, which is a computer that specializes in receiving and transmitting information. This router receives the get request for the Facebook home page and starts sending it to different routers until the request is finally sent to the server that contains the website. Facebook's servers read the request and send back the information that was requested, in this case the Facebook home page, through routers back to our guys portable computer. So without going into too much detail, this is how a website is accessed by a client. It is also important to remember that websites can be accessed like this without fail, unless there is an actual problem with the infrastructure of the internet. 
In general, there are two different kinds of websites. The first one is called a dynamic website, which is what Facebook is. A dynamic Website is one that is constantly being updated and is different for each user. The second type of website is called a static website. A static website is a page that is the same for all users and is not constantly being updated. Wikipedia is a good example of a static website. Most if not all websites user some sort of encryption method to keep material safe.
