Ruby Classes
Classes are an integral part of coding; their purpose is to create objects. A class can be compared to a cookie cutter that can make an infinite amount of similar cookies. These cookies always have the same dimensions, but can be customised and superficially changed. Like cookies, objects created from the same class are all the same; they all are internally the same, but can be superficially changed.A common web app that uses classes is Facebook, which uses an user class. This class would be the template that allows every user to design a profile that is used for the website. Within the user class, the designer’s of facebook defined methods that allow users to add pictures, link their emails, post comments, and like things. Another example of a app that utilises classes is snapchat. In snapchat there is also  a user class that allows all people who use the app to create their profile. All web applications that require users to log in or provide information use classes. There are no real disadvantages to using classes, besides the fact that can be somewhat confusing for the coder.

Object oriented design is a technique of coding that relies on interaction between objects instead of actions. Object oriented design relies on objects created by classes to interact between each other. Facebook relies on object oriented design because users, which are objects, interact with each other on the website.


In this example, this class is making objects that are bikes. The first important thing that can be seen is the def initialize line that is immediately after that the first line. This def initialize line basically runs at the beginning of the programm and defines all of the things that are stated. The rest of the code includes reader and rider methods which really define aspects of the bike , like the type of seat, the type of bike, and the type of tires. With this class one can make a virtual bike that has a brand, color, type, seat, and tires. 



Below is an example of class:
Class Bicycle 
			def initialize (brand, color, type)
			@brand = brand
			@color = color
			@type = type
			end 
			
			def bike_seat(seat)
				@seat = seat
				end

				def seat
					@seat
				end

			def bike_tire(tire)
				@tire = tire
			end

			def tire
				@tire 
			end
			
		end
